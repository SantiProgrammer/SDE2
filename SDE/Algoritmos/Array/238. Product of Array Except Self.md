# 238. Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,1,2,3]
Output: [6,30,15,10]
```

## Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
